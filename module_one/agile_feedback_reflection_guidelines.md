# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

I've learned that agile would be the ideal way to work, since it implies improving as you go as an individual and as a team, and it provides the oportunity to see results much more often, however the general tendency is to lean towards waterfall, where getting feedback on the product is done too late and, in many instances,it doesn't produce the expected results.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?

We mostly worked together on each of the tasks, but also branched out and worked on our own. We agreed to permanently communicate to each other and let each other know about our struggles and successes. We weren't 100% successful at implementing agile, but it felt like we were close to using it, since we did try to look for different approaches to the code and see what results we would get.

3. What role did you take on in the project? 

Since our team was made out of 2 leader-type people and 1 relationship oriented person, I tried my best to take on the role of the executor, and focus less(but not completely eliminate) on planning and organizing. 

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?

I would maybe DTR more, to make sure everyone is up do date with each of our expectations. 

5. How does retro function in a team project?

I think that it's about focusing on the 4 questiones mentioned in this week's class: 

What did you like?
What did you learn?
What did you lack?
What do you long for?

Answering these questins as a group can help the team mates feel a little more comfortable with each other, but also it can help improve all of their skills and/or abilities, by learning new perspectives from the other team mates.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

My feedback about our work was leaning towards coach, I think. I prefered to keep a list and check it from time to time, and remind my teammates that it's maybe time to move on to the next problem, and get back to the current one later. I also appreciated their understanding and support, when I had to take a break from the project to deal with some personal issues.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?

When I give feedback, I prefer to talk in first person plural, so that I am included in the coaching feedback process. It is my way of acknowledging that I am not above my team and that I, too, need to do the same thing I'm "preaching". I would like to be able to be more straight forward for the benefit of my team mates.
